Do You Have A Concussion, a concussion diagnostic aid created with Unity 5

An Android app that uses virtual reality (Google cardboard, Durovis Dive, or similar mobile virtual reality headset required) to administer three tests for concussion symptoms. Reaction time, memory, and balance are tested.

Created in the Unity 5 game engine.

For deployment to an Android device, DYHAC.apk in the Builds folder is the final build
